This is a Single Cycle MIPS Processor Simulator written in C++. Every one word in MIPS processor is assumed 32 bits. It uses BubbleSort.asm file as MIPS assembly code input and executes it.
In order to run it, this repository is to be cloned, compiled and then run. The BubbleSort.asm is a mips assembly program which sorts values using the bubble sort algorithm. It finally shows the values in the Memory and the values stored in each of the registers. There are two modes where one shows values in the memory and the registers once, after all the mips instructions are executed, and the other mode shows the same everytime an instruction is executed.
